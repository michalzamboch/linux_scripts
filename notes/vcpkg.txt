Using vcpkg with CMake: To use vcpkg with CMake, you need to specify the vcpkg toolchain file. This can be done by setting the CMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE variable when invoking CMake. For example:

cmake -B [build directory] -S . "-DCMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE=[path to vcpkg]/scripts/buildsystems/vcpkg.cmake"
cmake --build [build directory]

Replace [build directory] with your desired build directory and [path to vcpkg] with the actual path to your vcpkg installation.



Integration with IDEs: For Visual Studio Code with CMake Tools, you can add the following to your workspace settings.json:

{
  "cmake.configureSettings": {
    "CMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE": "[vcpkg root]/scripts/buildsystems/vcpkg.cmake"
  }
}

Replace [vcpkg root] with the path to your vcpkg installation.
